Modrinth uses the translations present in this repository across our projects, including our [website](https://github.com/modrinth/knossos) and [launcher](https://github.com/modrinth/theseus).

> **Warning**
> **You may want to wait before contributing** <br>
> We are currently in the process of setting up this project in crowd-sourced translation platform, [see issue #3](https://github.com/modrinth/translations/issues/3).
> <br>Using a dedicated translation service will make contributing much easier. All existing translations will be preserved.
