Modrinth uses the translations present in this repository across our projects, including our [website](https://github.com/modrinth/knossos) and [launcher](https://github.com/modrinth/theseus).

> **Warning**
> **You may want to wait before contributing** <br>
> We are currently in the process of setting up this project in crowd-sourced translation platform (Crowdin), [see issue #3](https://github.com/modrinth/translations/issues/3). Using a dedicated translation service will make contributing much easier. All existing translations will be preserved.

### Translation format

The translations use the [ICU message syntax](https://svelte-intl-precompile.com/en/docs/icu-crash-course), and are processed by [svelte-intl-precompile](https://svelte-intl-precompile.com/en/docs/introduction).

### Updates

Changes to the main branch in this repository will trigger updates in dependent repositories.
